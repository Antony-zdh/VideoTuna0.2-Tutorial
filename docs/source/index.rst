Welcome to VideoTuna v0.2's documentation!
===================================

`VideoTuna <https://github.com/VideoVerses/VideoTuna/>`_ is a useful codebase for text-to-video applications.
 VideoTuna is the first repo that integrates multiple AI video generation models including text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), text-to-image (T2I), and video-to-video (V2V) generation for model inference and finetuning (to the best of our knowledge).
ðŸŒŸ VideoTuna is the first repo that provides comprehensive pipelines in video generation, from fine-tuning to pre-training, continuous training, and post-training (alignment) (to the best of our knowledge).

Check out the :doc:source:`getting_started.rst` section for a detailed tutorial.
